# ember-auth-example

This is an example ember app that demonstrates using the following:

* ember / ember-cli (w/pods)
* [ember-simple-auth](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/)
* [waterline](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/)
* [waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline)
* [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass)

It is inspired by one of the ember-simple-auth [examples](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/blob/master/examples/1-simple.html).

I added Sass and waterline for fun.
